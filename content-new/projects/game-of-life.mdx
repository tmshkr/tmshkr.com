I designed and developed this React app based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), which has a few simple rules:

- Cells are either alive or dead
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Each generation is stored in a [doubly-linked list](https://github.com/tmshkr/game-of-life/blob/master/src/utils/history.js), which allows the user to step forward and backward in the game's history.

It was a lot of fun to make and can produce some interesting patterns, just with a few simple rules.
