This blog is now built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a free and open source static-site generator powered by React. Gatsby provides a framework for building modern, performant, production-ready websites that can be hosted anywhere as static files, with no need for a database or backend server.

Static-site generators are popular for this reason, because they don't need a backend server, so they are faster and require less maintenance than a website that needs its own database to generate pages server-side for clients. There are quite a few [static-site generators](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) out there. This blog was previously built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and I do still appreciate its philosophy, as it simply ["does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less."](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll#philosophy)

I found myself becoming more interested in JavaScript and React, though, so I decided to give Gatsby a try. React can be worked into any static-site generator, as I was using it before with Jekyll, but Gatsby is powered by JavaScript and React, so it makes things a bit more cohesive.
