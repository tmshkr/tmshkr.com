Hello, my name is Tim Shaker.

I'm currently studying [Full Stack Web Development](https://learn.lambdaschool.com/course/cs-fsw) at Lambda School.

Before that, I was mostly a self-taught developer, focusing on JavaScript, Node, and React through the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/tmshkr). I first learned the basics of programming in a C++ course at UCLA, and I've been tinkering with the web since I was a kid.

You can see some of the [projects](/projects/) I've made, [subscribe](/blog/subscribe) my [blog](/blog/), or [contact](/contact/) me directly.

If you're interested in how this website is made, see the [colophon](/colophon/).
